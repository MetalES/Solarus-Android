# Solarus for Android

Since Sam101 ported the 1.2 (I believe) version of Solarus to Android, there were no updated versions (MoS supported the widescreen resolution, so this is early versions)
The work should continue, both Solarus and Android were greatly improved over time (Solarus is now 1.5, Android's CPU are deca-core)

The PSP version got scrapped, I never was able to run Mystery of Solarus, it was slow as fuck (even with some tweaks / optimisations), the only way to make it possible on the PSP is to run it through emulators (PPSSPP) and that's useless, I'll maybe take a look on the Vita.

The Solarus Launcher (i.e: list of all games before starting a quest) might be ported using Embarcadero (https://www.embarcadero.com/fr/) a tool for easier android-styled menu creation

There are some things I want to implement onto this.

- Bluetooth controller support (playing on screen is cool, but playing with a plysical controller like an iPega like this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_DJy-VZutQ) is super cool)
- Fullscreen (that means, widescreen, should take a look at how it's handled in Sam101's version)
- Quest reading SHOULD be in internal memory, but users can define the default folder or launch a quest located elsewhere (SD card master race).
- Do not take the "auto quest downloader" that was in Sam101's version, at least the Solarus launcher doesn't include it so I think that user might take quest all by themselves, when Solarus would allow this, this will be interesting, I have an idea for the GUI)

I might not be able to succeed, that's why I'm gonna hang around the XDA forums to seek some peps.
